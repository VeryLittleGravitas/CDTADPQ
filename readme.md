# California Alerts, made with Very Little Gravitas

## 1. California Alerts

[California Alerts](https://vlg-ctdadpq.herokuapp.com) ([https://vlg-ctdadpq.herokuapp.com](https://vlg-ctdadpq.herokuapp.com)) is a faster, clearer, simpler way for California residents and visitors to find out about emergencies that may affect them and for State emergency workers to assess and inform the public about emergencies.

For California residents and visitors, California Alerts:

* lets users receive up-to-date emergency and non-emergency alerts so that they can keep themselves, their loved ones and the people they're responsible for safe
* lets users choose a location (a zipcode) for which they will receive emergency and non-emergency alerts 
* lets users choose whether to receive alerts by SMS or email (with forthcoming push notification functionality)
* lets users sign up quickly and easily, by only requiring a phone number and a zipcode

For authorized State emergency workers, California Alerts: 

* publishes automatic fire alert emergency notifications based on up-to-date data to registered users whose location is within a 50 mile geofence of a fire, so that the public are automatically notified about fire emergencies
* lets users visualize up-to-date data fire, river gauge, weather hazard, earthquake, tsunami and other natural hazards from the U.S. Geological Survey, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Department of Interior that is in California or may affect California, so that users can assess and make decisions about publishing emergency or non-emergency notifications
* lets users publish manual emergency notifications to all users, so that the public can be informed about emergencies
* lets users publish manual non-emergency notifications to all users, so that the public can be informed about non-emergency situations
* lets users track data about published notifications 
* lets users track data about registered users 

## 2. Our team

The Product Manager, Dan Hon, also served as Product Owner in the agile delivery process. We assigned him as the assigned leader of the project with full responsibility and authority to build the prototype, and has full accountability for the quality of the prototype.

## 3. Agile Delivery Process

The agile delivery process used at Very Little Gravitas is based on the open standards Scrum framework, with input and iterative feedback from user-centered design techniques. 

Documentation on the [full agile delivery process](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/wiki/Agile-Delivery-Process)

For the purposes of the ADPQ submission, we implemented a simplified process, appropriate to the scope and available time. 
The following describes the four 1 week sprints that were completed for the design and build of the prototype. 

#### Sprint 1
* Defined usecases & personas
* Discussed and clarified requirements 
* [User research journal](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/wiki/Research-journal)
* [Design exploration](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/wiki/Design-exploration) 
* [Technical exploration](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/wiki/Technical-exploration)
* Set up a Slack group for team communication
* Set up a [kanban board](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/projects/1) in the teamâ€™s Github repo for use as a lightweight product backlog and sprint task board 

#### Sprint 2

[TODO: LIST OUT DELIVERED SCOPE, REFERENCE USER STORIES FROM KABAN]

#### Sprint 3

[TODO: LIST OUT DELIVERED SCOPE, REFERENCE USER STORIES FROM KABAN]

#### Sprint 4

[TODO: LIST OUT DELIVERED SCOPE, REFERENCE USER STORIES FROM KABAN]


## 4. User-Centered Design 
We used a number of different user-centered design techniques in developing the prototype:

* [User survey](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/wiki/Research-journal), to better understand the expectations of a wide number of potential users of our system (quantitative research)
* [Personas](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/wiki/Personas), to create representative archetypes of our users
* [Interviews](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/wiki/Research-journal#interview-diary), to ask in more detail focussed questions about user expectations (qualitative research)
* [Interactive user testing](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/wiki/Research-journal#user-testing-remote-week-3), to see if our users are able to successfully use our service


## 5. Deployment Instructions 

See our documentation to [install and run the prototype](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/wiki/Installing-and-running-the-prototype)

## Procurement Requirements

The RFI explicitly identifies 20 requirements (a-t) for the prototype submission. Without duplicating the headings, we provide evidence below of how we have met each criteria:

a. We appointed Dan Hon as both Product Manager and leader of the project. He helped the team understand the requirements, was responsible for prioritizing work, and is ultimately accountable for the quality of the submitted prototype 

b. Section 2 (above) identifies each member of the multidisciplinary team and their specialisms. 

c. We surveyed over 30 potential users of the service, and conducted detailed interviews with a number of individuals. Insights gathered from these user research exercises were fed directly into the design exploration and reflected in the implementation of requirements. See the [research journal](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/wiki/Research-journal) on the project wiki for further evidence.

d. We used the user-centered design techniques outlined in Section 4 (above).

e. See the project [commit history](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/commits/master) in Github.

f. **Used Swagger to document the RESTful API, and provided a link to the Swagger API;**

[TODO: we have created 1 API in this project that returns a zipcode for a given latitude and longitude, but need swagger documentation link]

g. See the code repository for the specifics of how the user-facing templates were implemented [commit history](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/commits/master). They are written with standards complient, acessible, semantic HTML using [Progressive Enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement), directly using the U.S. Web Design Standards which are fully complient with ADA and WCAG 2.0. See [Pattern Library Accessibility Notes](https://standards.usa.gov/getting-started/designers/#notes-on-accessibility).

h. This project uses the [Draft U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/) as style guide and/or pattern library. See [Pull Request 13](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/pull/13) for the initial implementation of the pattern library.

i. See [Research journal](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/wiki/Research-journal) for evidence of usability testing videos, as well as notes from interviews.

j. The lightweight scrum process we used provided a review point at the end of each sprint, enabling us to reflect users' feedback into the grooming and planning session of the subsequent sprint. This has allowed us to iteratively produce features that reflect real users' requirements. See Section 3 (above) for further detail. 

k. We have chosen to use the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards with no custom HTML. This pattern library was chosen to ensure the delivery of a responsive design that works on multiple devices.

l. We are using the following modern, open-source technologies for this prototype:

1. Our prototype is written in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/).
2. [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org), a micro web framework for Python based on [Werkzeug](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/), the WSGI toolkit, and [Jinja 2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/), a templating language based on Django's templating approach. The Flask framework also features integrated support for unit testing and RESTful request dispatching.
3. [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) for ensuring the correct Python packages are installed to support the application
4. [PostgreSQL 9](https://www.postgresql.org), an enterprise-grade database used by government agencies in the U.S. such as The National Weather Service, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and State Department. 
5. [PostGIS](http://www.postgis.net), a spatial database extender for the Postgres database. PostGIS adds support for geographic objects, allowing for location queries to be run in SQL.
6. The [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov), which provides design guidelines and code to quickly create trustworthy, accessible and consistent digital government services that meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
7. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) as our prototype's platform-as-a-service.
8. [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org), for continuous integration and testing. 
9. [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com) for sending SMS notifications to users.
10. [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com) for sending email notifications to users.
